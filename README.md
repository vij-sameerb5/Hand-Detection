# Hand-Detection

**HandDraw** is an innovative real-time gesture-based drawing project that uses **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection and **OpenCV** for drawing visualizations. The software captures hand movements through the camera and translates them into drawings, providing an engaging, interactive user experience. It's a Python-based project that blends **AI** and real-time image processing to create an exciting, creative platform for users to draw in mid-air using hand gestures.

The project features real-time detection of hand movements, easy-to-use interfaces, and customizable colors and shapes, making it both accessible and versatile. By simply using hand gestures like moving your fingers, you can select colors and draw shapes on the screen. The software is designed to be highly accurate and efficient, powered by **MediaPipe**'s robust hand-tracking capabilities. Itâ€™s easy to set up with a few commands, allowing users to explore a fun and creative way to draw.

In the future, **HandDraw** aims to introduce more gesture types for additional actions like undoing strokes or changing colors, and possibly recognizing multiple hands simultaneously. The project also envisions enhancing the user interface to make the experience more interactive and intuitive, offering users more creative freedom through advanced gesture controls.
